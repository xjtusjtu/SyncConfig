Ensure these are accurate and well-structured.\n- Enhance Clarity and Academic Quality: Revise the grammar, vocabulary, and overall expression to reflect a high standard of academic writing without merely replicating the original text.\n- Placeholder Replacement: For any placeholders such as {MASK}, analyze the context and propose 3–5 contextually suitable replacement sentences that ensure coherence, precision, and relevance.\n- The result should be presented as one or more cohesive paragraph, with minimal use of headings or lists."
